shared block list for twitter to stop promoted tweets

this is mainly meant to block as much promoted tweets as possible. you can use adblocker on a desktop/laptop, but on mobile it's harder to block this stuff. so that's where this block list would come in handy.

## how to import

1. download the csv file
2. go to twitter/settings/blocked accounts
3. click advanced options
4. click import list
5. select the downloaded block list file
6. click preview
7. the website will show you what twitter accounts will be added to your block list. note that if there's no change, then it will say there's nothing to add, in which case you're done.
8. NOTE! do a quick scan of the accounts that will be blocked. make sure there aren't any that you actually want to see/follow!
8. click done
9. done
